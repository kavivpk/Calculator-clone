## 🚀 Features

- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Percentage (`%`)
- Toggle sign (`+/-`)
- Clear screen (`C`)
- Decimal support (`.`)
- Real-time calculation with the `=` button
- Styled with a clean dark mode interface

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-web-calculator.git
````

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

3. Use the buttons to perform calculations. Click `C` to clear and `=` to get results.

## 📌 Dependencies

* No external libraries or frameworks required.
* Runs entirely in the browser.

## ⚠️ Note

* The `eval()` function is used for calculation. While suitable for small projects, it's not safe for production applications due to security risks.
* The `( )` and `+/-` buttons are currently placeholders and may require additional logic for full functionality.


## 📄 License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

If you'd like, I can help improve the calculator (e.g., add keyboard support, fix `( )` and `+/-` behavior, or avoid using `eval()`). Just let me know!
